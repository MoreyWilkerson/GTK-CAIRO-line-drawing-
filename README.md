# line_git

Simple GTK application that allows for multiple lines through the use of linked lists. Built primarily for better understanding of Drawing in GTK. 

WLS/linux compiling
gcc -Wno-format -o motrk motrk.c -Wno-deprecated-declarations -Wno-format-security -lm `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` -export-dynamic

alternatively, you can type in ./compile.script. 

side note - if you are trying to learn GTK, I highly reccomend kevin o' kanes glade videos on youtube. very informative, and sorts out the mess of GTK.
